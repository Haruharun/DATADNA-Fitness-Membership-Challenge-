## Overview  
This analysis was developed as part of the Data DNA August 2025 Challenge, where I took on the role of a data analyst at MyGym, a rapidly expanding fitness center chain with multiple locations across California. The project explores membership behavior, engagement patterns, and retention dynamics using real-world data from MyGym’s operations.
By analyzing trends in subscription types, service usage, and regional performance, the goal is to uncover actionable insights that can help MyGym optimize member satisfaction, reduce churn, and drive strategic growth across its diverse locations
